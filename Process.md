To implement this in **React with blockchain integration**, hereâ€™s a **high-level architecture and roadmap**:

---

### **1. Tech Stack**
- **Frontend:** React.js with Tailwind/Bootstrap for UI
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js (if needed for additional API management)
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum (Smart Contracts with Solidity)
- **Storage:** IPFS for private data (optional)
- **Wallet Integration:** MetaMask or WalletConnect
- **Library for Blockchain Interaction:** ethers.js or web3.js
- **Database (if needed):** Firebase / Cloud Firestore

---

### **2. Roadmap**
#### **Phase 1: Blockchain ID Creation Web App**
âœ… **Step 1: User Visits Web App**
- Show a clean UI with a **"Create Blockchain ID"** button.
- Connect to **MetaMask / Wallet**.

âœ… **Step 2: User Logs In (Creates Genesis Block)**
- On login, create a **genesis block** for the user on the blockchain.
- Allow users to select **public vs. private** details.
- Save private data in encrypted format (or off-chain in IPFS).

âœ… **Step 3: User Interaction (Pattern + Timestamp)**
- Capture user interactions like typing speed, mouse movement, etc.
- Convert interaction data into a **unique cryptographic key**.
- This key is used to **create a new block** in the blockchain.

---

#### **Phase 2: Secondary Website (Login via Blockchain ID)**
âœ… **Step 4: User Uses Blockchain ID to Sign Up**
- Users can **sign up on the secondary website using the blockchain key**.
- The website will verify the **user key** from the blockchain.
- Map the blockchain key to the user profile.

âœ… **Step 5: User Logs In Again (With Another Key)**
- If a user generates a new blockchain key from another interaction,
- The login system should recognize the **same user profile** from previous keys.

âœ… **Step 6: Blockchain ID Authentication**
- Whenever a user logs in with a blockchain ID, the system verifies:
  - Is the **key valid** (exists in the blockchain)?
  - Is it **linked to the user profile**?
  - If valid â†’ Log in, else **reject**.

---

### **3. Implementation Details**
- **Smart Contract (Solidity)**
  - Store User Genesis Block with public/private metadata.
  - Store user interactions as unique transaction hashes.
  - Validate user identity using transaction history.

- **React + Ethers.js**
  - Handle MetaMask authentication.
  - Fetch blockchain transactions for login validation.

- **IPFS (For Private Data)**
  - Store encrypted private data.
  - Link the hash reference in the blockchain.

- **Login Flow**
  - User provides **wallet signature** for verification.
  - System retrieves stored blockchain **keys** to authenticate.

---

### **Next Steps**
âœ… **Start with the Smart Contract:**
- Define how **Genesis Blocks & User Keys** will be stored.
- Develop **functions to store/retrieve** user data.

âœ… **Setup React Frontend with MetaMask Integration**
- Install **ethers.js** or **web3.js**.
- Implement **wallet connection & user signup**.

âœ… **Build the Secondary Website for Login**
- Ensure **same user profiles** are accessible from different blockchain keys.
