🔗 [Behavioral Blockchain Identity System – Live Site](https://behavioral-biometric-v1.netlify.app/)

---

## 🔍 Overview  
**Behavioral Blockchain Identity System** is a secure identity framework that uses behavioral biometrics and blockchain technology to create a **pattern-based decentralized identity**. The platform enables users to draw unique patterns and store identity information immutably on a blockchain system, making it ideal for systems needing secure authentication and transparent verification.

---

## ✨ Features  
- 🔐 **Decentralized Identity Storage** using Blockchain  
- 🧠 **Behavioral Biometrics-based Pattern Entry System**  
- 🧾 **User-Controlled Public/Private Field Visibility**  
- 🔄 **Real-Time Pattern Drawing & Matching**  
- 🧩 **Dynamic Field Form Generation**  
- 🔍 **Secondary Web App for Identity Lookup**  
- 📊 **Firestore Integration for Secure Data Handling**

## 🖼️ Screenshots & Preview

### 1. **Hero Section (Landing Page)**  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f97dbefa-92b0-4b8e-bef0-3ef621da8db2" width="100%" />
The Hero page introduces the core idea of the platform — "Where Behavior Becomes Identity." It highlights how behavioral traits like typing patterns and gestures are used for secure identity verification. The clean design, bold text, and supporting graphic emphasize data visibility control and user privacy, while the "Checkout" button invites users to explore further.

### 2. **Authentication: Signin**  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b7a1384-57d5-4c9f-8b1a-124f6b4292b4" width="100%" />
The Signup page allows new users to create an account by entering their first name, last name, email ID, password, and confirming the password. With a clean, centered layout on a soft blue background, it ensures a smooth onboarding experience. The "Create Account" button stands out, while a toggle link makes it easy to switch to the Sign In page.

### 3. **Authentication: Signup**  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6df9cb4a-8a48-4349-9212-782047341ae2" width="100%" />
The Signin page is designed for returning users to log in securely using their email ID and password. It features a centered card layout on a light blue gradient background, offering a minimal and focused interface. The page also includes a clear option to switch to the Signup page for new users.

### 4. **Dashboard – Pattern-based Identity Creation**  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eab081a1-66ac-40a6-8940-a0baa1085518" width="100%" />
The Dashboard page warmly welcomes the user by name and provides a clean, responsive interface to input personal data and draw a custom pattern. Users can add multiple form fields, control visibility settings, and visualize their pattern in a grid-based canvas, making the block creation process intuitive and secure.


---

### 5. **Block Creation Confirmation**

### 6. **Secondary Web App – Login via Block ID**  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa146b36-fc1c-45dc-a3a3-3c8fad44d173" width="100%" />
The Secondary Website Login screen allows users to access their data using their unique Personal Block ID. This page serves as a secure entry point on the secondary web app, ensuring that only authorized users with a valid block ID can view the associated identity data.

---

### 7. **Secondary Web App – Data Display**  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0442a559-f381-4843-b651-a425979faa9d" width="100%" />
The Data Display screen showcases the user's identity information retrieved from the blockchain block using the entered Block ID. It neatly presents both public and private data fields based on visibility settings defined during block creation, offering a clean and secure way to view user-authenticated data.

# **How It Works**

### ✅ **Step 1: Sign Up / Log In**  
Users begin by creating an account or logging in using their email and password. Authentication is securely handled through **Firebase Authentication**, ensuring smooth user onboarding.

---

### 🔧 **Step 2: Fill Identity Fields & Set Visibility**  
Users are presented with a dynamic form where they can enter details such as **Name, Email, Date of Birth**, etc.  
Each field includes a **visibility toggle**, allowing users to choose whether the field is **publicly visible** or kept **private** when data is later accessed via the blockchain.

---

### ✍️ **Step 3: Draw a Behavioral Pattern**  
On the right side of the dashboard, users draw a **gesture-based unlock pattern**, capturing their unique behavioral input.  
This pattern is stored as part of the block and adds an additional layer of **identity verification** using behavioral traits.

---

### ⛓️ **Step 4: Save as a Blockchain Block**  
Once the form is filled and the pattern drawn, a **block is created and stored in the blockchain**.  
A unique **Block ID** (serving as a cryptographic key) is generated and shown in a popup.  
This Block ID can be used later to retrieve the associated data.

> ✅ **Note:** To simulate **stale vs fresh data handling**, the block creation process is executed **twice**.  
> - The first block contains the original data.  
> - The second block demonstrates how **updated fields and behavioral patterns** overwrite the previous state while retaining traceability.  
> - This showcases how the system **handles changes to user identity** over time in a secure, versioned manner.

---

### 🔁 **Step 5: Access via Secondary Web App**  
On the secondary platform, users can input their **Block ID** to retrieve and view **publicly visible** data fields.  
This ensures **decentralized verification** without exposing private data, making it ideal for **third-party validation scenarios**.
